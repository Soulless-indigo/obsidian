### The Concept of Society
- In common parlance the word society usually designates the membres of specific in-group persons rather than the social relationships
- sometimes society designates institutions
- in routine life, everyone often defines society as an aggregation or collection of individuals
- but in sociology and anthropology, the term 'SOCIETY' REFERS to:
	- not just a group of people 
	- a complex pattern of norms of interaction that exist among them 
	- an  intangible entity: it is a mental *construct* , which the membres of the society maintain themselves 
	- some anthropologists say that society exists only when the membres know each other and possess *common interests*
